\chapter{PRBS Modeling and Implementation of Pole Placement Controller}
The aim of this chapter is to do PRBS testing on Single Board Heater System by the application of PRBS signal 
and to design a pole-placement controller. The target group is anyone who has basic knowledge of control engineering. The first half of this chapter is dedicated to do system identification of the SBHS system using the response obtained for a 
PRBS (Pseudo Random Binary Sequence) input. In the second half, a pole-placement controller is designed using this model and 
implemented on SBHS.

\section{PRBS Modelling}

Similar to Chapter \ref{chap1} and \ref{chap2}, we will find the transfer function model of SBHS. 
But there are two major differences. First difference is that we will give a Pseudo Random Binary Sequence to the 
heater input of SBHS and the second difference is that we will find the discrete time transfer function. A Pseudo Random 
Binary Sequence is nothing but a signal whose amplitude varies between two limits randomly at any given time. An 
illustration of the same is given in figure \ref{prbs-fig}. A PRBS signal can be easily generated using the $rand()$ 
function in Scilab. Scilab code to generate the PRBS signal is given at the end of this chapter.

We have used Scilab with Xcos as an interface for sending and receiving data. This interface is shown in figure \ref{prbs-xcos}.
Heater current and fan speed are the two inputs to the system. The heater current is varied with a PRBS signal. A provision
is made to set the parameters like PRBS amplitude and offset value. A provision is also made to time the occurance of the PRBS 
input using a step block. The value of step time in the step block has to be chosen carefully. Sufficient amount of time
should be given to allow the temperature to reach a steady-state before the PRBS signal is applied. In this experiment we are
keeping the fan speed constant at 50\%. The temperature profile thus obtained is the output.

\subsection{Issues with Step Test and an Alternate Approach}

SBHS is an example of a heater. Suppose you are working in a full scale plant. Current control system designed to control
one of the heaters of the plant is lousy and your supervisor asks you to design a new controller from scratch. The first step
you need to do is identification of the heater transfer function. The catch is, the plant is currently
operational. You can't shut the plant down to identify the heater transfer function. You have to do it while the heater is
operating in the plant. You might think of giving the heater a positive step and measuring the response in the controlled 
temperature. This will increase the temperature of the component being heated for the period of time step is applied. However,
if the process is sensitive to temperature of the component (distillation, for example), it will go off the desired course and
the output of the whole plant will be affected and will be undesirable.\\

There is an alternate approach which is widely used in industry. The input given to the heater for identification is not 
step, but a \textbf{pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS)}. The concept behind PRBS is that the input is perturbed in such
a way that the time average of the input is the value at which it is being operated currently. Thus, some positive and some
negative steps can be given. This results in some positive and some negative changes in the temperature which leads to the time
average of the performance of the plant remaining the same. Thus, PRBS testing can be done in a working plant without 
affecting the plant performance unlike step testing. A typical PRBS and corresponding plant output is shown in 
figure \ref{sample-prbs}

\section{Conducting PRBS Test on SBHS locally}
The detailed procedure to perform a local experiment is explained in Chapter\ref{sercomm}. A summary of the same is provided in section \ref{local-summary} It is same for this section with following changes.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Step1: The working directory is {\tt  prbs/identification}

\subsection{Determination of Discrete Time Transfer Function}\label{prbs-model}

System identification is carried out to identify the transfer function between the input signal to the system and output 
from the system. Firstly, a transfer function with unknown parameters is assumed. The system is given a known input and its
response is obtained and then the values of the unknown parameters is chosen such that the sum of squares of the errors is 
minimized. Here, the error is the difference between the actual output and the output predicted by the transfer function model
assumed.
For the given SBHS system, we assume a second order transfer function:

\begin{align}\label{DTF}
G(z)=\frac{b_{1}+b_{2}z^{-1}}{1+a_{1}z^{-1}+a_{2}z^{-2}}z^{-d}
\end{align}


The unknown parameters $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ and $d$ are to be obtained through the response of the system to the known inputs.
$a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ are real numbers and $d$ is the plant delay which is an integer.  For these model parameters estimation, we
use a pseudo random binary sequence (PRBS) input. Since the optimization over discrete variables ($d$ in this case) is a very 
difficult routine for computers, we assume a value for $d$ and then optimize over  $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$. The optimization 
problem, then, becomes:


\begin{align}
(\hat{b_1}, \hat{b_2}, \hat{a_1}, \hat{a_2})=\underset{b_1, b_2, a_1, a_2}{argmin}\sum_{i=0}^{N}(y(k)-\hat{y}(k))^{2}
\end{align}


Here, $y(k)$ is the output obtained from the system- so it is known. $\hat{y(k)}$ is the estimated output using $y$ the model 
assumed, which can be written as a difference equation:

\begin{align}
\hat{y}(k) = -a_1\hat{y}(k - 1) - a_2\hat{y}(k - 2) + b_1 u(k - d) + b_2 u(k - 1 - d)
\end{align}

The optimization is performed using the optimization routine “optim” of Scilab. Copy the  data file to the folder 
{\tt prbs\_analysis}. Change the Scilab working directory to {\tt prbs\_analysis} folder. Open the file {\tt optimize.sce} 
and put the name of the data file (with extention) in the filename field. Save and run this code and obtain the plot as 
shown in figure 4.3. This code uses the routines {\tt label.sci}, {\tt costfunction.sci} and {\tt second\_order.sci}. This 
code will give optimized values for $a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$ which can be used to define a second order discrete time transfer 
function as given in equation \ref{DTF}. The results generated after executing optimization routine over the data file 
obtained earlier is shown in figure \ref{prbs-fit} and figure \ref{prbs-model}. The initial values were chosen to be 
[0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5]. The value of $err$ along with the fit obtained has to be used to change the initial values and the value 
of $delay$. The transfer function thus obtained is 

\begin{align}\label{model}
G(z)=\frac{0.0057384 - 0.0057355 z^{-1}}{1.9529968z^{-1}+0.9162750z^{-2}}z^{-4}
\end{align}

\section{Performing PRBS testing on SBHS, locally}
The step by step procedure for conducting an experiment locally remains same as explained in section \ref{local-steps} with the following changes
\begin{itemize}
\item The working folder is prbs/identification/
\item Use the getd command getd ../../common\_files
\item In section \ref{local-steps} read all instances of step\_test as prbstest
\end{itemize}
The steps to identify the transfer remains same as explained in the section \ref{prbs-model}

\section{Implementing 2DOF pole-placement controller using PRBS model, virtually}

For deriving the Two degrees of freedom control law, please refer to the chapter \ref{2dof}
The controller was designed for the given transient conditions, rise time = 10 sec, overshoot = 0.1. The experimental result and performance of the controller for setpoint temperature change from 38.00 to 43.00 degree C, i.e. 5 degree C positive step change, has been shown below in Fig \ref{2dof-controller}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{prbs/prbs-2dof-controller.png}
\caption{2dof controller response}
\label{2dof-controller}
\end{figure}

 The parameters for the 2-DOF pole-placement controller obtained are shown here
\begin{align*}
Tc &= 1 - 1.9444137 z^{ -1} + 0.9447818 z^{ -2}\\
Sc &= 0.0337719 - 0.0656666z^{ -1}+ 0.0319071z^ { -2}\\
Rc &= 10^{-9} (4377900 - 12034140 z^{ -1} + 11094713 z^ {-2} - 3436740.5 z^{-3} + 3.469D^{-09} z ^{-4} \\&- 147850.06 z^ {-5} + 146117.57 z^{ -6} )\\
\gamma &= 0.0337719
\end{align*}

As can be observed from the graph of temperature vs. time (third subplot) in Fig \ref{2dof-controller}, the overshoot criteria was satisfied very easily. The rise time criteria is observed to be more than 30 sec. This can be satisfied with experimentation.
The paramenters are computed by the file {\tt twodof\_para.sce}.

\item The working folder is prbs/controller/
\item Use the getd command getd ../../common\_files
\item In section \ref{vlabsexpt} read all instances of step\_test as prbstest
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Block diagram explanation of Single Board Heater System}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{blkdiag.jpg}
\caption{Block Diagram}
\label{blkdig}
\end{figure}
Figure\ref{blkdig} shows the block diagram of \textquoteleft Single Board Heater System\textquoteright. Microcontroller ATmega16 is used and is the heart of the setup. Two serial communication ports namely RS232 and USB can be used to connect the setup to a computer. A particular port can be selected by setting the jumper to its appropriate place. The communication between PC and setup takes place via a serial to TTL interface. The microcontroller can be programmed with the help of an In-system programmer port(ISP) available on the board. The \textmu C operates the Heater and Fan with the help of separate drivers. The driver comprises of a power MOSFET. A temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature and fed to the \textmu C through an Instrumentation amplifier. Some required parameter values are displayed along with some LED indications.
\section{Microcontroller}
Some salient features of ATmega16 are listed below
\begin{enumerate}
\item 32 x 8 general purpose registers.
\item 16K Bytes of In-System Self-Programmable flash memory
\item 512 Bytes of EEPROM
\item 1K Bytes of internal Static RAM (SRAM)
\item Two 8-bit Timer/Counters
\item One 16-bit Timer/Counter
\item Four PWM channels
\item 8-channel,10-bit ADC
\item Programmable Serial USART
\item Up to 16 MIPS throughput at 16 MHz
\end{enumerate}
Microcontroller plays a very important role. It controls every single hardware present on the board, directly or indirectly. It executes various tasks like, setting up communication between PC and the equipment, controlling the amount of current passing through the heater coil, controlling the fan speed, reading the temperature, displaying some relevant parameter values and various other necessary operations.
\subsection{PWM for heat and speed control}
The Single Board Heater System has a Heater coil and a Fan. The heater assembly consists of an iron plate placed at a distance of about 3.5mm from a nichrome coil. When current passes through the coil it gets heated and in turn raises the temperature of the iron plate. We are interested to alter the heat generated by the coil and also the speed at which the fan is operated.
There are many ways to control the amount of power delivered to the Fan and Heater. We are using the PWM technique.
PWM or pulse width modulation is a process in which the duty cycle of the square wave is modulated.
\begin{align}
      \text{Duty cycle} = \frac{T_{ON}}{T}
\end{align}
Where $T_{ON}$ is the ON time of the wave and  T is the total time period of the wave. Power delivered to the load is proportional to T- ON time of the signal. This is used to control the current flowing through the heating element and also speed of the fan.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pwm}
\caption{Pulse Width Modulation (A): On time is $90\%$ of the total time period,    (B): ON time is $10\%$ of total time period}
\end{figure} 
An internal timer of the microcontroller is used to generate a square wave. The ON time of the square wave depends on a count value. Hence, by varying this count value one can vary the width of the waveform. Therefore, by using this technique, PWM waveform is generated at the appropriate pin of the microcontroller. This generated PWM waveform is used to control the power delivered to the load (Fan and Heater). A MOSFET is used to switch at the PWM frequency which indirectly controls the power delivered to the load. A separate MOSFET is used for the two loads. The timer is operated at 244Hz.
\subsection{Analog to Digital conversion}
As explained earlier, the heat generated by the heater coil is passed to the iron plate through convection. We would now want to measure the temperature of this plate. For this purpose a temperature sensor AD590 is used.
Some of the salient features of AD590 include
\begin{enumerate}
\item Linear current output: 1\textmu A/K
\item Wide range: -55\textcelsius to +150\textcelsius
\item Sensor isolation from case
\item Low cost
\end{enumerate}
The output of AD590 is then fed to the microcontroller through an Instrumentation amplifier. The signal so obtained would be in analog form. It has to be converted in to digital form to make it understandable for the microcontroller. An ADC would be an obvious solution. ATmega16 features an 8-channel , 10 bit successive approximation ADC with 0-Vcc(0 to Vcc) input voltage range. An interrupt is generated on completion of analog to digital conversion. Here, ADC is initialize to have 206 $\mu$ sec of conversion time . Digital data so obtained is sent to computer via serial port as well as for further processing for on board display.
\section{Instrumentation amplifier}
Whenever there is a temperature measurement task at hand, instrumentation amplifiers are often used. A typical three Op-Amp Instrumentation amplifier is shown in the figure\ref{instramp}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{Inst_Amp}
\caption{3 Op-Amp Instrumentation Amplifier}
\label{instramp}
\end{figure}
The instrumentation amplifiers (IA)have the advantage of very low DC offsets, high input impedance, very high Common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) etc. They are mostly prefered where the sensor is located at a remote place, susceptible to signal attenuation. The IA's have a very high input impedance and hence dose not loads the input signal source. IC LM348 is used to construct a 3 Op-Amp IA. IC LM348 contains a set of four Op-Amps. Gain of the amplifier is given by equation \ref{ia}
\begin{align}
\frac{V_o}{V_2-V_1}=\left\{1+\frac{2R_f}{R_g}\right\}\frac{R_2}{R_1}
\label{ia}
\end{align} 
The value of $R_g$ is kept variable to change the overall gain of the amplifier.
The signal generated by AD590 is in \textmu A/\textdegree K.  It is converted to mV/\textdegree K by taking it across a 1K\textohm  resistor. The  \textdegree K to\textdegree C conversion is done by subtracting 237 from the \textdegree K result. One input of the IA is fed with the mV/\textdegree K reading and the other with 273mV. The resulting output is now in mV/\textdegree C. The output of the IA is fed to microcontroller for further processing.
\section{Communication}
The set up has the facility to use either USB or RS232 for communication between set up and computer. A jumper is been provided to switch between USB and RS232.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{c.jpg}
\caption{Jumper arrangement}
\end{figure}
The voltages available at the TXD terminal of microcontroller are in TTL logic. The RS232 standard uses a different terminology. Voltage level below -5V is treated as logic 1 and voltage level above +5V is treated as logic 0. There are many reasons for RS232 using such terminology. One reason is to ensure error free transmission over long distances. For solving this compatibility issue an external hardware interface is required. IC MAX202 serves the purpose. IC MAX202 is a +5V RS232 transreceiver.
\subsection{Serial port communication}
Serial port is a full duplex device i.e. it can transmit and receive data at the same time.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{RS232cable.jpg}
\caption{RS232 cable}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Serialport.jpg}
\caption{Serial port}
\end{figure}
ATmega16 support a programmable Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous serial receiver and transmitter(USART) . Its baud rate is fixed at 9600 bps with character size set to 8 bits and parity bits disabled.
\subsection{Using USB for Communication}
After setting the jumper to USB mode connect the set up to the computer using a USB cable at appropriate ports as shown. To make the setup USB compatible USB to serial conversion is necessary. IC FT232R is used for this purpose.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{usbc.jpg}
\caption{USB communication}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{usbp.jpg}
\caption{USB PORT}
\end{figure}
You need to have proper USB driver being installed on your computer.
\section{Display and Resetting the setup}
The temperature of the plate, percentage values of Heat and Fan and the machine identification number (MID) are displayed on LCD connected to the microcontroller.
As shown in figure, numerals below TEMP , indicate the actual temperature of the heater plate . Numeral below HEA and FAN indicate the respective percentage value at which heater and fan are being operated. Numerals below MID corresponds to the Device identification number.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{display.jpg}
\caption{Display}
\end{figure}

The set up could be reset at any time by pressing the reset button on it as shown in figure \ref{reset}. Reseting the setup takes it to the standby mode where the heater current is forced to be zero and fan speed to be the maximum value. Though these reset values are not displayed on the LCD display but they are loaded to the appropriate units.

\chapter{Using Scilab with Single Board Heater System}\label{sercomm}
This section explains the procedure to use Single Board Heater System with Scilab. An open loop experiment, step test is used for demonstrating this procedure. The process however remains the same for performing any other experiment explained in this document, unless specified. 
\section*{Hardware and Software Requirements}\label{umlauts}
For working with the Single Board Heater system, you would require the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item SBHS with USB cable and power cable.
\item PC/Laptop with Scilab software installed (preferably the latest version). You may download it from:\\ {\tt http://www.scilab.org/products/scilab/download}
\item FTDI Virtual Com Port driver corresponding to the OS on your PC. (You may download it from: 
{\tt http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/VCP.htm})
\item Example StepTest provided along with this document.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Accessing Single Board Heater system on a Windows System}
\label{win_procedure}
This section deals with the procedure to use SBHS on a windows Operating System. The Operating System used for this document is Windows 7, 64-bit OS. In case if you are using some other Operating System or the steps explianed here are not sufficient to understand, you can refer to the official document available on  the main ftdi website. For doing so, go to www.ftdichip.com. On the left hand side panel, click on 'Drivers'. In the dropdown menu, choose 'VCP Drivers'. Then on the web page page, click on 'Installation Guides link'. Choose the required OS document. We would now begin with the procedure.
\subsection{Installing necessary driver and COM Port Settings}
After powering ON the SBHS and plugging in the USB cable to the PC (making sure you check the jumper settings on the board) for the very first time, the {\tt Welcome to Found New Hardware Wizard} dialog box pops up. You have to choose the option {\tt Install from a list or specific location}. Choose {\tt Search for best driver in these locations}. Check the button {\tt Include this location in the search}. Click on {\tt Browse}. Specify the path where you have copied the driver (item no.3) and install it by clicking {\tt Next}. Once the wizard has successfully installed the driver, your SBHS is ready for use. Please note that this procedure has to be repeated twice.

Now, we would check the communication port number assigned to the computer port to which you connect the Single Board Heater System, via an RS232 or USB cable.  For checking the port number, right click on My Computer and click on properties. Here, select the hardware tab and then click on Device Manager. You would see the list of hard ware devices. Look for Ports(COM \& LPT) option and open it. You would see the various communication port your computer is using. If you have connected RS232 cable, then look for Communications Port(COM1) else look for USB Serial Port. For RS232 connection, the port number mostly remains COM1. For USB connection it may change to some other number. Note the appropriate COM number. This process is illustrated in figure \ref{com_number}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{COM.jpg}
\caption{Checking Communication Port number}
\label{com_number}
\end{figure}

Sometimes the COM port number you get after connecting a USB cable is more then single digit number 9. Since the serial tool box can handle only single digit port number, it is necessary to change your COM port number. Following is the procedure to do the same.
After following the procedure for knowing your com port number described above, double click that particular port. Click on Port Settings tab and then click on Advanced. In the COM port number dropdown menu, choose the port number to any other number less than 10. This procedure is illustrated in figure \ref{com_change}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{port2.jpg}
\caption{Changing Com port number}
\label{com_change}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Configuring Scilab}
\label{scilab_sbhs}
Launch Scilab from start menu or double click the scilab icon on the desktop. Before executing any scripts which are dependent on other files or scripts, one has to change the working directory of scilab. Doing so will tell scilab from where it has to load the other necessary files. If you have other files saved to any other directory, you have to say {\ttfamily  getd<space>folder\_path} in the scilab console. Type {\ttfamily ls} to see the if the files are available. Here the directory is changed to the place where the relevent files for performiong step test resides. To change the directory, click on file menu and then choose "Change directory". You can also change the directory by typing {\tt cd<space>folder path}. Next, click on {\ttfamily editor} from the menu bar to open the scilab editor or simply type {\ttfamily editor} in the scilab console and open the file {\ttfamily ser\_init.sce}. Change the port number (the first argument of the {\tt openserial()} function) to the COM port number that you have noted down before. The second argument of the {\tt openserial()} function requires baud rate, parity, data bits and stop bits as a string.You should give it as {\tt "9600,n,8"}. Since stop bit is zero in our case, omit the parameter from the string to indicate it as zero. Execute this .sce file. You will get a message {\tt COM Port Opened}. If it complains, reconnecting the USB cable and/or restarting Scilab may help. Now execute the {\tt step\_test.sci} file.  The results are illustrated in figure \ref{loader}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{scilab1.jpg}
\caption{Executing script files}
\label{exec}
\end{figure}


Type {\ttfamily Xcos} on the scilab console or click on Applications and choose {\ttfamily Xcos} to open Xcos environment. Load the {\ttfamily step\_test.xcos} file from the File menu. The Xcos interface that will open is as shown in figure \ref{Xcosintr}. You can set the block parameters by double clicking on the block as shown in figure \ref{blk_parameters}. To run the code click on Simulation menu and choose start. After running Xcos successfully you would see the plots as shown in figure \ref{plots}. See that the values of fan and heater you input to the xcos file is getting reflected on the board display. To stop the experiment click on the {\ttfamily stop} option on the menu bar of the Xcos environment.

\section{Accessing Single Board Heater system on a Linux System}\label{linux_scilab}
This section deals with the procedure to use SBHS on a Linux Operating System. The Operating System used for this document is Ubuntu 10.04.
For Linux users, the instructions given in section \ref{win_procedure} hold true with a few changes as below:

You do not require FTDI COM port drivers for connecting your SBHS to the PC. After plugging in the USB cable to your PC, check the serial port number by typing {\tt ls /dev/ttyUSB*} on the terminal, refer Fig.\ref{lstty}. Usually, the highest numbered one will be your device port number. eg:- {\tt /dev/ttyUSB0}. If you want to connect more than one USB device, then type {\tt tail -f /var/log/messages|grep ttyUSB} on the linux terminal just before plugging in the individual USB cable, refer Fig.\ref{tailusb}. The USB number will then be shown on the screen. Press {\tt Ctrl+ c} to abort the command. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{lstty.png}
\caption{Checking the port number in linux (1)}
\label{lstty}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{tailusb.png}
\caption{Checking the port number in linux (2)}
\label{tailusb}
\end{figure}

Note this number and change the port number (the first argument of the \\ {\tt openserial()} function) in the {\tt ser\_init.sce} file with it. The second argument of the {\tt openserial()} function should be {\tt "9800,n,8,0"}, refer Fig.\ref{linuxserial}. This defines baud rate, parity, data bits and stop bits in that order. It has been found that if we omit the last parameter i.e., stop bits instead of specifying it as zero, scilab gives an error. Execute this file. Once the serial port initialisation is succesfully done, you get a message as shown in Fig.\ref{console_linux}. If it complains, reconnecting the USB cable and/or restarting Scilab may help.

\label{console_linux}
\end{figure}

Now execute the {\tt step\_test.sci} file.  The results are illustrated in figure \ref{loader}. Type {\ttfamily Xcos} on the scilab console or click on Applications and choose {\ttfamily Xcos} to open Xcos environment. Load the {\ttfamily step\_test.xcos} file from the File menu. The Xcos interface that will open is as shown in figure \ref{Xcosintr}. You can set the block parameters by double clicking on the block as shown in figure \ref{blk_parameters}. To run the code click on Simulation menu and choose start. After running Xcos successfully you would see the plots as shown in figure \ref{plots}. See that the values of fan and heater you input to the xcos file is getting reflected on the board display. To stop the experiment click on the {\ttfamily stop} option on the menu bar of the Xcos environment.
%Follow the instructions as given for Windows OS in section \ref{scilab_sbhs} for executing an example step test. This has been tested in Ubuntu Linux 10.04.

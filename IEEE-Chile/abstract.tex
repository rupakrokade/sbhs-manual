\begin{abstract}
  This work presents a virtual control laboratory, based on a single
  board heater system and free and open source software, such as
  Scilab, Xcos, Java, PHP/MySQL and GNU/Linux.  This solution allows
  of the order of 20 devices to be handled by a single Server PC.  It
  allows many students to carry out control experiments remotely.
  It has been extensively tested
  in two control courses at IIT Bombay.  Results of a few experiments,
  conducted remotely, using this setup are presented.

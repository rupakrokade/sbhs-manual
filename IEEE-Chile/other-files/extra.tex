With the limited time and resources,
students are given hands-on practice with the usually costly
experimental setups. But this does not encourage them to try out new
experiments which may be out of their course of study. Also, costly
devices prevent their usage in the absence of lab experts. In IIT
Bombay, with the objective of promoting in-depth understanding and
narrowing the gap between control theory and practice, we have
designed and developed a Single-board heater system which is a
low-cost control setup with open source design, code and acquisition
interface.  This paper, with the proposed low-cost device, attempts to
smoothen the tranisition from concept to application and academia to
industry. 

Any control course experiment would involve a process and the data
acquisition interface. The control setups available in labs, for
experiments, are generally huge and expensive. Keeping in mind safety
and the components of the setup, only limited number of experiments
are allowed on those. The proposed setup has a potential to overcome
these shortcoming and reach the masses.

There are two folders in this folder. 

1.codes
2.report

The folder named 'codes' contains the codes that were used. It has its own readme.txt file that should be read first before executing any code.

The folder named 'report' contains the latex files that were required for making the report. The pdf document of the final report is also there. For convenience, I have copied the same pdf here. 

The name of the tex file is self_tuning_report_vikas.tex. This file was written using MikTex 2.7 and TeXnicCenter 1.0 Stable Release Candidate 1.

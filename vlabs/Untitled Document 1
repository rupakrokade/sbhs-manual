The SBHS server is based on Python-Django framework and is linked to Apache server using Apache's WSGI module. The MySQL database server has the details of all the registered users, their slot details, authentication keys to allow remote access, etc. As shown in Figure 4.5, the Python-Django server has pages for registration, login, slot booking etc. [9].  On the client end, control algorithms are running in Scilab and a python based client application communicates with virtual labs server over the Internet.

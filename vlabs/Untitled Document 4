In this section we will see the steps involved in conducting experiments using virtual lab.

This section assumes that the necessary files and software are available on the users computer. Files can be downloaded from the website {\bf sbhs.os-hardware.in/downloads} as shown in fig \ref{fig:sbhs-website}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user goes to the vlabs home page and if he is a first time visitor, he registers himself and follows the information provided there, else he directly logs in.
\item After logging in, the user will book a slot.
\item In the experiment folder the settings.txt file will be edited as per requirement. The client should take care not to make any unneccesary changes to this file. The example settings are anyways given in the end of this file.

\item The user will now start the python client. On windows OS, double clicking on the run.bat file will open the command prompt. On linux OS, one has to first go to the directory where the experiment files (.sce and .py) are kept. This can be done by typing {\tt cd<space>directory name} on the terminal. Linux users should also bypass the terminal proxy settings, if any, by executing the command {\tt export http proxy=’’} on the terminal. Be informed that this is just a temporay disable of terminal proxy and it should be done everytime you open a fresh terminal. Linux user should now type the command {\tt python sbhsclient.py} on the linux  terminal. 
\item The python client will first do some network checks. If it finds the network to be NOT ok for experimentation, it will put the message "No network connection".Else, if it finds the network to be ok for experimentation, it will communicate with the server and will authenticate the user if he is authorised to access the particular SBHS at the booked time. If the user is not authorised it he/she will get the message "Authentication failed. Please check your username and password". If the user is authenticate but has not booked the slot, he/she will get the message "No valid slot found. Please book a slot before starting the experiment". Also if the settings.txt file is not properly configured, it will give error {\tt Invalid settings in the "setttings.txt" file}. If every thing is fine, the client will get the "Login Successfull message." It will also display the log file name and the time left for experimentation.
\item The user now launches scilab, changes the directory to the folder where the necessary .sce, .sci and .xcos files of an experiment of interest resides. The user will execute the scilab code (.sce file) pertaining to the experiment. If the network connection is fine, it will automatically open the corresponding .xcos file. Else it will output a message on the scilab console {\tt No network connection}.
\item The user will run the xcos file. It will open a plot of the various experimental parameters. This process will continue until the experiment is stopped or the simulation time is lapsed. The simulation time can be changed by changing the {\tt final integration time} parameter available in the {\tt set up} option in the {\tt simulation} menu on the Xcos window.

\item The slot is made to last for 55 minutes. The last 5 minutes of the slot are used to reset the SBHS so that the next user will get the SBHS at a normal operating condition. The python client ceases connection automatically as soon as 55 minutes are over. Please note that there will be no pop up warning and the experiment will be stoped automatically.
\item A log of the experimental data with time stamp is maintained on the client side. It is also available to download using the "Download" link once you login on the sbhs vlabs website.
\end{enumerate}
